Using heat kernel techniques, we find that in the high-momentum limit the quadratic part of the action does not contain positive powers of the derivatives. We interpret this as the fact that the two point Green functions vanish for nearby points, where the proximity scale is given by the inverse of the cutoff.},

Our problems are about α the correspondence a ↔ a between physicial quantities a and quantum operators a (quantization) and β the possibility of understanding the statistical character of quantum mechanics by averaging over uniquely determined processes as in classical statistical mechanics (interpretation). α and β are closely connected. Their meaning depends on the notion of observability. We have tried to put these problems in a form which is fit for discussion. We could not bring them to an issue. (We are inclined to restrict the meaning of α to the trivial correspondence a → a (for lim ħ → 0) and to deny the possibility suggested in β). Meanwhile special attention has been paid to the measuring process (coupling, entanglement; ignoration, infringement; selection, measurement). For the sake of simplicity the discussion has been confined to elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics of scalar (spinless) systems with one linear degree of freedom without exchange. Exact mathematical rigour has not been aimed at.},

	abstract = {An attempt is made to interpret quantum mechanics as a statistical theory, or more exactly as a form of non-deterministic statistical dynamics. The paper falls into three parts. In the first, the distribution functions of the complete set of dynamical variables specifying a mechanical system (phase-space distributions), which are fundamental in any form of statistical dynamics, are expressed in terms of the wave vectors of quantum theory. This is shown to be equivalent to specifying a theory of functions of non-commuting operators, and may hence be considered as an interpretation of
              quantum kinematics
              . In the second part, the laws governing the transformation with time of these phase-space distributions are derived from the equations of motion of
              quantum dynamics
              and found to be of the required form for a dynamical stochastic process. It is shown that these phase-space transformation equations can be used as an alternative to the Schrödinger equation in the solution of quantum mechanical problems, such as the evolution with time of wave packets, collision problems and the calculation of transition probabilities in perturbed systems; an approximation method is derived for this purpose. The third part,
              quantum statistics
              , deals with the phase-space distribution of members of large assemblies, with a view to applications of quantum mechanics to kinetic theories of matter. Finally, the limitations of the theory, its uniqueness and the possibilities of experimental verification are discussed.},

	abstract = {We present an effective unified theory based on noncommutative geometry for the standard model with neutrino mixing, minimally coupled to gravity. The unification is based on the symplectic unitary group in Hilbert space and on the spectral action. It yields all the detailed structure of the standard model with several predictions at unification scale. Besides the familiar predictions for the gauge couplings as for GUT theories, it predicts the Higgs scattering parameter and the sum of the squares of Yukawa couplings. From these relations, one can extract predictions at low energy, giving in particular a Higgs mass around 170 GeV and a top mass compatible with present experimental value. The geometric picture that emerges is that space–time is the product of an ordinary spin manifold (for which the theory would deliver Einstein gravity) by a finite noncommutative geometry FFF. The discrete space FFF is of KO-dimension 6modulo 8 and of metric dimension 0, and accounts for all the intricacies of the standard model with its spontaneous symmetry breaking Higgs sector.},

This larger symmetry mixes gauge and spin degrees of freedom without introducing extra fermions.

	abstract = {The assumption that space-time is a noncommutative space formed as a product of a continuous four dimensional manifold times a finite space predicts, almost uniquely, the Standard Model with all its fermions, gauge fields, Higgs field and their representations. A strong restriction on the noncommutative space results from the first order condition which came from the requirement that the Dirac operator is a differential operator of order one. Without this restriction, invariance under inner automorphisms requires the inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator to contain a quadratic piece expressed in terms of the linear part. We apply the classification of product noncommutative spaces without the first order condition and show that this leads immediately to a Pati-Salam SU(2)\_\{R\}x SU(2)\_\{L\}x SU(4) type model which unifies leptons and quarks in four colors. Besides the gauge fields, there are 16 fermions in the (2,1,4)+(1,2,4) representation, fundamental Higgs fields in the (2,2,1), (2,1,4) and (1,1,1+15) representations. Depending on the precise form of the order one condition or not there are additional Higgs fields which are either composite depending on the fundamental Higgs fields listed above, or are fundamental themselves. These additional Higgs fields break spontaneously the Pati-Salam symmetries at high energies to those of the Standard Model.},

It is intended for graduate students in mathematics/theoretical physics who are new to the field of noncommutative geometry, as well as for researchers in mathematics/theoretical physics with an interest in the physical applications of noncommutative geometry. In the first part, we introduce the main concepts and techniques by studying finite noncommutative spaces, providing a “light” approach to noncommutative geometry. We then proceed with the general framework by defining and analyzing noncommutative spin manifolds and deriving some main results on them, such as the local index formula. In the second part, we show how noncommutative spin manifolds naturally give rise to gauge theories, applying this principle to specific examples. We subsequently geometrically derive abelian and non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories, and eventually the full Standard Model of particle physics, and conclude by explaining how noncommutative geometry might indicate how to proceed beyond the Standard Model.},

	abstract = {The Spectral Action Principle in noncommutative geometry derives the actions of the Standard Model and General Relativity (along with several other gravitational terms) by reconciling them in a geometric setting, and hence offers an explanation for their common origin. However, one of the requirements in the minimal formalism, unification of the gauge coupling constants, is not satisfied, since the basic construction does not introduce anything new that can change the renormalization group (RG) running of the Standard Model. On the other hand, it has been recently argued that incorporating structure of the Clifford algebra into the finite part of the spectral triple, the main object that encodes the complete information of a noncommutative space, gives rise to five additional scalar fields in the basic framework. We investigate whether these scalars can help to achieve unification. We perform a RG analysis at the one-loop level, allowing possible mass values of these scalars to float from the electroweak scale to the putative unification scale. We show that out of twenty configurations of mass hierarchy in total, there does not exist even a single case that can lead to unification. In consequence, we confirm that the spectral action formalism requires a model-construction scheme beyond the (modified) minimal framework.},

We present explicit expressions for these coefficients on manifolds with and without boundaries, subject to local and non-local boundary conditions, in the presence of various types of singularities (e.g., domain walls). In each case the heat kernel coefficients are given in terms of several geometric invariants. These invariants are derived for scalar and spinor theories with various interactions, Yang-Mills fields, gravity, and open bosonic strings. We discuss the relations between the heat kernel coefficients and quantum anomalies, corresponding anomalous actions, and covariant perturbation expansions of the effective action (both "low-" and "high-energy" ones).},
